# User Metrics

It is one of my old ventures named User Metrics. It was a community management tool for community managers. There is only landing page and registration system of the product exists.

- [usermetrics-server]("https://github.com/DogukanTopcu/usermetrics/tree/master/usermetrics-server") is a nodejs based server. It connects to MySQL database and has a model-view-controller structure. It also includes a discord bot to send new emails to our discord. The landing page and the product are connected to this server.

- [usermetrics-landingpage]("https://github.com/DogukanTopcu/usermetrics/tree/master/usermetrics-landingpage") is a landing page written in Nextjs that collects customers' emails.
You can access the user interface from this [link]()

- [usermetrics]("https://github.com/DogukanTopcu/usermetrics/tree/master/usermetrics") This is part of the main product. It only includes login sign up. Also you can log in with Google. I recommend you to examine it with usermetrics-server to understand it better.
